Okay, let me rephrase I have a client. Tiffany Smith has recently been promoted to
the C-suite of a local digital software company. Her parents were well known in the community
due to their very successful careers and involvement with local charities before their passing. You have confirmed in Connect that Tiffany
does not have an existing relationship with JP Morgan. You plan to reach out to Tiffany to tell her
your story and introduce the private bank. You have been researching LinkedIn and her
company's website to learn more about her. You have learned that her husband is a public
school teacher in the area, and they are likely in their mid-to-late 40s. They have two kids based on Tiffany's LinkedIn
posts about work while life balance and her goal of spending any time outside of work,
focused on her family. She hasn't been responsive on LinkedIn and
finally got her on the phone for 10 minutes. Now can I answer these questions? 1. Present the private bank and the value we
provide. 2. Discuss the intent-driven framework and process
for how we work with clients. 3. Learn about her family's financial goals and
aspirations. 4. Secure follow-up meeting. You
