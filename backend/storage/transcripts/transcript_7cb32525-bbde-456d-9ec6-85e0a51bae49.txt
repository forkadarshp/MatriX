I'm going to call Linda Gray to help her earn interest on her cash. She will be depositing in seventy thousand one hundred ks per month. Should I advise on VHPXX or PLJX? Also, what questions can I ask to see if she wants to invest a portion of that into the markets? I could suggest CEGX or JMS6 or even VOO or SPY. She's forty two years old.
