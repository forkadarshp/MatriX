My client wants to split her asset so that her 
husband receives 25% and her son receives 75%. Currently, she has individual accounts without 
an assigned beneficiary in the amount of $822,000. Her other accounts are as follows.
Scene 9923-3006 Sydney M. Hunn, IRA
Beneficiaries 33%
To Adam Moore, Jefferson, Spouse 67% to Jonathan R. Hun, son, C81278001, Mary M. 
Moon, I.N.T.I.R.A. Beneficiaries, 34% to Adam Moore Jefferson, spouse, 66% to Jonathan R. Hun, son.
Please suggest the best way to divide the assets to accomplish her goal knowing that the 
individual account gets a step up in basis and taking into account the tax 
implications of the IRA accounts.
