What we are trying to show is Washington estate taxes. These were updated on May twentieth to be more drastic at the state level shown in the chart below, but the federal rate has remained the same. We are trying to show these changes and the impact it will have on our clients who live in Washington. Some things I would like to show on the slides are: previous versus new rates. See below of the numbers. Feel free to paste a version of this into the PowerPoint. There are two Excel calculators attached above, one for an individual's estate taxes and one for a married couple.
