Sarah's Uncle Moe recently passed away in his hometown of San Clemente, CA. The only estate planning document found in Moe's possession was a will signed on July twenty eight, twenty twenty two. The will names Sarah as the personal representative of Moe's estate. Sarah hires Julia, a T and E attorney, as counsel to help probate the estate. It turns out that Mo only owned two assets: A primary residence valued at twenty poutilimas, subject to an eight planibular mortgage, and PIP2, a savings account with a value of nine million dollars Both assets were titled only in Mohs' name and are subject to probate. Under California law, what is the amount of the personal representative's fees that will be paid to Sarah for her services as PR of Mo's estate? Under California law, what is the amount of the attorney's fees that will be paid to Julia for her legal services? How could Mo have avoided these fees?
