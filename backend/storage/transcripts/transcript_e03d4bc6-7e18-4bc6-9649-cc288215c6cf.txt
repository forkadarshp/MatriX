My client wants to split her assets so that
her husband receives 25% and her son receives 75%. Currently, she has individual accounts without
an assigned beneficiary in the amount of $822,000. Her other accounts are as follows. C9923306
Sydney M. Hunn, IRA. Beneficiaries 33% to Adam Moore Jefferson,
Spouse. 67% to Jonathan R. Hunn, Son. C81278001, Mary M. Moon, Inh. IRA. Beneficiaries 34% to Adam Moore Jefferson
- Spouse, 66% to Jonathan R. Hund Son. Please suggest the best way to divide the
assets to accomplish her goal. Knowing that the individual account gets a
step up in basis and taking into account the tax implications of the IRA accounts. passage hit the server apparently
