Please explain this further, especially the part about the 10% federal tax penalty. If your beneficiary receives a scholarship for higher education expenses, you can withdraw an amount equal to the value of the scholarship from your accounts. Earnings on the amount you withdraw would be subject to income taxes at the ordinary federal income tax rate, but would not be subject to the additional 10% federal tax penalty. You could also choose to change the beneficiary of your account.
