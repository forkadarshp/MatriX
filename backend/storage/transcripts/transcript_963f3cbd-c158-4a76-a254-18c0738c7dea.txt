Im going to call Julia Miles to help her earn
interest on her cash. She will be depositing in 70 to 100k per month. Should I advise on VPHX or PLHX? Also, what questions can I ask to see if she
wants to invest a portion of that into the markets? I could suggest CGX or JMSX or even VOO or
SPI. She is in her late 30s and 39 years old. and 39 years old. Dole!]
