I'm going to call Julia Miles to help her earn interest on her cash. She will be depositing in 70 to 100 k per month. Should I advise on VPHX or PLHX? Also, what questions can I ask to see if she wants to invest a portion of that into the markets? I could suggest CGX or JMSX or even VOO or SPY. She is in her late thirties and 39 years old.
