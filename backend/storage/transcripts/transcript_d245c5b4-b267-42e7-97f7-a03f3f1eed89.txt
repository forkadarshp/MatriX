These are the instructions I received for a task. Give me some examples of estate planning slides that I can edit in order to better fit this description. What we are trying to show is Washington estate taxes. These were updated on May twentieth to be more drastic at the state level, shown in the chart below, but the federal rate has remained the same. We are trying to show these changes and the impact it will have on our clients who live in Washington. Some things I would like to show on the slides are: previous versus new rates. See below of the numbers. Feel free to paste a version of this into the PowerPoint. There are two Excel calculators attached above, one for an individual's estate taxes, and one for a married couple. I would like to put these into client friendly format in the PowerPoint. Maybe do one slide each for individual and married. Make sure to include the assumptions section. Taxable amount, previous incremental rate, new incremental rate, new tax owed zero to one thousand thousand dollars, ten percent of taxable amount, ten percent of taxable amount, one thousand thousand dollars to two thousand thousand dollars, fourteen percent of the amount over one thousand thousand dollars plus one hundred thousand dollars fifteen percent of the amount over one thousand thousand dollars plus one hundred thousand dollars two thousand thousand dollars to three thousand thousand dollars fifteen percent of the amount over two thousand thousand dollars plus two hundred and forty thousand dollars twenty percent of the amount over two thousand thousand dollars plus two hundred and fifty thousand dollars three thousand thousand dollars to four thousand thousand dollars sixteen percent of the amount over three thousand thousand dollars plus three hundred and ninety thousand dollars twenty one percent of the amount over three thousand thousand dollars plus four hundred and fifty thousand dollars four thousand thousand dollars to six thousand thousand dollars eighteen percent of the amount over four thousand thousand dollars plus five hundred and fifty thousand dollars twenty two percent of the amount over four thousand thousand dollars plus seven hundred and twenty thousand dollars six thousand thousand dollars to seven thousand thousand dollars nineteen percent of the amount over six thousand thousand dollars plus nine hundred and ten thousand dollars twenty four percent of the amount over six thousand thousand dollars plus one hundred and forty thousand dollars seven thousand dollars to nine thousand thousand dollars nineteen point five percent of the amount over seven thousand thousand dollars plus one by one hundred thousand dollars twenty six percent of the amount over seven thousand thousand dollars plus thirteen ninety thousand dollars nine thousand thousand dollars and above twenty percent of the amount over nine thousand thousand dollars plus one thousand two hundred and ninety thousand dollars twenty eight percent of the amount over nine thousand thousand dollars plus nineteen ten thousand dollars My client earns above twenty thousand dollars plus seventy five percent of that is inherited, as an example, and her son receives fifteen thousand dollars and her daughter receives five thousand dollars
