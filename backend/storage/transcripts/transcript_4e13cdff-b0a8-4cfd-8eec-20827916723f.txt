I'm talking to a ABC exec and pitching for their defined benefit. It is the first week of June. I am talking to a ABC exec that has a total cash comp of six hundred thousand dollars. They live in NYC but love the married to another executive on the street. They have a child who is out of college and gainfully employed. They have not deferred before. What kind of question should I ask, and what question should I anticipate?
