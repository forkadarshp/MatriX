I need you to help me with planning a portfolio for a client profile. Assume that we are going through the standard ABC model of building a portfolio of asset classes. Consider the following questions. A few factors, potential questions to think about: What is your client's return expectation for their capital? What is the tolerance for volatility? What is the potential drawdown for the asset allocation that you are pitching? What type of drawdown can your client stomach? What is the time horizon for their portfolio? Do they think about their portfolio as one big pot or do they segment it in terms of different buckets based on different goals? CIO-specific question A, what is this portfolio? What is it comprised of? B, how does this help me achieve my goals? C, who manages it? Who makes the decision as what assets go in this portfolio? D, what is the asset mixture in the portfolio? E, what's the track record? F, should I just not invest in a few ETFs? Is this not basically the same thing as what you are pitching me? G, how much return can I expect from this portfolio in the next five, 10, 15 years? I would think about leading with CIO, but not constrained if you want to freestyle." "Client number one, 27-year-old world traveler received $40 milloners from his trust fund and now wants to invest into a public portfolio. He is young and has a long-term time horizon for his portfolio, is thinking about allocating the whole $40 milloner into an S&P 500 ETF as nothing beats the US but is open to hearing ideas."
