What should I offer you recently onboarded a new 
client, John, who is a tech founder, a CEO. Last year he made 10mm net of tax from the sale of his 
startup. He is currently taking some time off to relax and begin thinking about his next project. 
The 10mm cash is in a money market fund in his ABC brokerage account. Up until now John has rented, 
but he recently started shopping for a home in SF. He has identified a 5mm property he likes and 
is interested in making an offer. You two have call scheduled to discuss next steps. When you 
speak with John, be prepared to address the following questions. Does John need a mortgage? 
Why or why not? If he does take out a mortgage, does he need to apply for it right away?
John has heard the term “cash-out refinance.” He doesn’t know what it means or if it’s relevant 
to him, but he would like you to explain it. What mortgage products do we offer and 
which one would you recommend he chooses? Consider the current macroeconomic 
environment and John's risk tolerance. What are some of the key differentiators 
of ABC's mortgage platform? T-V ok
