I am going to call Julia Miles to help her earn interest on her cash. She will be depositing in 70 to 100k per month. Should I advise on VPHX or PLHX? Also, what questions can I ask to see if she wants to invest a portion of that into the markets? I could suggest CGX or GMSX or even VOO or SPY. She is in her late 30s and 39 years old.
