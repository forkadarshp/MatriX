How would the private bank respond to this prospective client's email to me, Zach? I appreciate you sending over the info and fees and such certainly ABC brings an accomplished and effective team to the table, worthy of remuneration, and ABC rates are competitive as financial aspects pertain to me, my will and trust recently revised. No heirs, selling Fedlock by year end. Selling my CRE at some point in 2026. My investments and my trading are doing superbly well I have zero debt, personally and professionally, own my own home outright. I realize that your team is solid at the different aspects of financial management. I don't think it's a fit for me at this time. I'm very comfortable handling my own investments as well as active trading mostly options, futures, equities having spent five years at ACLI, DU, then Commodities Corp. In Princeton and Malibu, working with Michael Marcus, Bruce Kovner and others, and getting to know trading tactics from them, as well as folks like PTJ. My only queries are how best to mitigate the tax hits as I take chips off the table when I sell my company and my CRE. I have a good CPA team though, as well as good legal advisors. Let's stay in touch, and who knows, there might be opportunities down the road.
