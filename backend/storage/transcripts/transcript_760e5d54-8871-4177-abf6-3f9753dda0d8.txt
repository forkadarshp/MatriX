How would the private bank respond to this
prospective client's email to me, Zach? I appreciate you sending over the info and
fees and such. Certainly, ABC brings an accomplished and
effective team to the table. Worthy of remuneration, and ABC rates are
competitive. As financial aspects pertain to me, my will
and trust recently revised. No errors. Selling Fedlock by year-end. Selling my CRE at some point in 2026. My investments and my trading are doing superbly
well, I have zero debt, personally and professionally, own my own home outright. I realize that your team is solid at the different
aspects of financial management. I don't think it's a fit for me at this time,
I'm very comfortable handling my own investments, as well as active trading, mostly options,
futures, equities having spent 5 years at ACLI, DU, then, Commodities Corp in Princeton
and Malibu, working with Michael Marcus, Bruce Bruce Kovner and others, and getting to know
trading tactics from them as well as folks like PTJ. My only queries are how best to mitigate the
tax hits as I take chips off the table when I sell my company and my CRE. I have a good CPA team though, as well as
good legal advisors. stay in touch and who knows there might be
opportunities down the road go go go go I'll see you in the next video
