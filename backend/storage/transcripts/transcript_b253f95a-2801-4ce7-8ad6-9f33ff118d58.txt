"My client wants to split her assets so that her husband receives 25% and her son receives 75%. Currently, she has individual accounts without an assigned beneficiary in the amount of $822,000. Her other accounts are as follows, C992334006, Sidney M. Hunn IRA, beneficiaries 33% to Adam Moore Jefferson, spouse, 67% to Jonathan R. Hunn, son. C812378001, Mary M. Moon, INE IRA, beneficiaries 34% to Adam Moore Jefferson, spouse, 66% to Jonathan R. Hunn, son. Please suggest the best way to divide the assets to accomplish her goal, knowing that the individual account gets a step up in basis and taking into account the tax implications of the IRA accounts."
