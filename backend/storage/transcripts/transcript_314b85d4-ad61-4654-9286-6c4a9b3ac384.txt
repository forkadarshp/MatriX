I'm talking to a ABC exec and pitching for their defined benefit. It is the first week of June. I am talking to a ABC exec that has a total cash comp of 600,000 dollars. They live in New Yorks, but love the mountains and plan to relocate to California in 11-15 years. They are in their 50s and are married to another executive on the street. They have a child who is out of college and gainfully employed. They have not deferred before. What kind of questions should I ask, and what question should I anticipate?
