What should I offer you recently onboard at a new client, John, who is a tech founder CEO? Last year, he made 10 millimeter net of tax from the sale of his startup. He is currently taking some time off to relax and begin thinking about his next project. The 10 millimeter cash is in a money market fund in his ABC brokerage account. Up until now, John has rented, but he recently started shopping for a home in SF. He has identified a 5 millimeter property he likes and is interested in making an offer. you two have a call scheduled to discuss next 
steps. When you speak with John, be prepared to address the following questions. Does 
John need a mortgage, why, or why not? If he does take out a mortgage, does 
he need to apply for it right away? John has heard the term “cash out refinance”. He 
doesn’t know what it means or if it’s relevant to him, but he would like you to explain it.
What mortgage products do we offer and which would you recommend he chooses? Consider the 
current macroeconomic environment and John's risk tolerance. What are some of the key 
differentiators of ABC's mortgage platform?
