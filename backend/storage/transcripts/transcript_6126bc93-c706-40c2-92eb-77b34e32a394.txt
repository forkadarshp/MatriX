So I'm talking to a ABC exec and pitching for their defined benefit. It is the first week of June. I am talking to a ABC exec that has a total cash comp of six hundred cals. They live in NYC but love the mountains and plan to relocate to California in eleven fifteen years. They are in their fifties and are married to another executive on the street. They have a child who is out of college and gainfully employed. They have not deferred before. What kind of questions should I ask, and what questions should I anticipate?
