These are the instructions I receive for a task. Give me some examples of estate planning slides that I can edit in order to better fit this description. What we are trying to show is Washington estate taxes. These were updated drastic at the state level, shown in the chart below, but the federal rate has remained the same. We are trying to show these changes and the impact it will have on our clients who live in Washington. Some things I would like to show on the slides are: Previous versus new rates. See below of the numbers. Feel free to paste a version of this into the PowerPoint. There are two Excel calculators attached above, one for an individual's estate taxes and one for a married couple. I would like to put these into client friendly format in the PowerPoint. Maybe do one slide each for individual and married. Make sure to include the assumptions section. Taxable amount, previous incremental rate, new incremental rate, new tax owed, dollars zero to one thousand thousand dollars ten percent of taxable amount: ten percent of taxable amount: one thousand thousand dollars to two thousand thousand dollars fourteen percent of the amount over one thousand thousand dollars plus one hundred thousand dollars fifteen percent of the amount over one thousand thousand dollars plus one hundred thousand dollars two thousand thousand dollars to three thousand thousand dollars fifteen percent of the amount over two thousand thousand dollars plus two hundred and forty thousand dollars twenty percent of the amount over two thousand thousand dollars plus two hundred and fifty thousand dollars three thousand thousand dollars to four thousand thousand dollars sixteen percent of the amount over three thousand thousand dollars plus three hundred and ninety thousand dollars twenty percent of the amount over three thousand thousand dollars plus four hundred and fifty thousand dollars four thousand dollars six thousand dollars eighteen percent of the amount over four thousand dollars plus five hundred and fifty thousand dollars twenty two percent of the amount over four thousand dollars plus seven hundred and twenty thousand dollars six thousand dollars seven thousand dollars nineteen percent of the amount over six thousand dollars plus nine hundred and ten thousand dollars twenty four percent of the amount over six thousand dollars plus eleven forty thousand dollars seven thousand dollars one thousand dollars to nine thousand dollars nineteen point five percent of the amount over seven thousand dollars one thousand dollars plus eleven hundred thousand dollars twenty six percent of the amount over seven thousand dollars plus thirteen ninety thousand dollars nine thousand plus one thousand dollars and above twenty percent of the amount over nine thousand dollars plus fourteen hundred and ninety thousand dollars twenty eight percent of the amount over nine thousand dollars plus one hundred and ten thousand dollars My client earns above twenty thousand dollars plus seventy five percent of that is inherited, as an example.
