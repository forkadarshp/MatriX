I'm going to call Linda Gray to help her earn interest on her cash. She will be depositing in seventy to one hundred k per month. Should I advise on VHPXX or PLJXX? Also, what questions can I ask to see if she wants to invest a portion of that into the markets? I could suggest SEGX or JMSIX or even VOO or SPY, she is forty two years old.
