I'm talking to an ABC exec and pitching for their defined benefit. It is the first week of June. I am talking to an ABC exec that has a total cash comp of six hundred ks. They live in NYC but love the mountains and plan to relocate to California in eleven to fifteen years. They are in their 50s and are married to another executive on the street. They have a child who is out of college and gainfully employed. They have not deferred before. What kind of questions should I ask and what questions should I anticipate?
